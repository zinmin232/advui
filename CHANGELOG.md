## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-26

First release of **Adv UI**. Repository: https://github.com/zinmin232/advui.

### Added

- **Components** (`@advui/core`): Button, IconButton, Input, Textarea,
  Label, Checkbox, Radio Group, Switch, Select (beta), Card, Badge, Avatar,
  Separator, Dialog, Toast (beta), Tabs, Tooltip, Alert, Progress, Spinner,
  Skeleton, Typography (Text, Heading, Kbd), Stack (Box, Stack, HStack, VStack,
  Center, Spacer), Grid, Container.
- `UniversalProvider` with color mode (`light`/`dark`/`system`), an icon
  registry, a built-in toaster and safe-area `insets` passthrough.
  `useColorMode`, `useControllableState` and `useReducedMotion` hooks.
- **Theme** (`@advui/theme`): `createUniversalConfig` with 10 presets,
  any brand color (OKLCH scale generation), WCAG AA contrast enforcement,
  global radius and font scale, media queries, shadows and z-index layers.
- **Icons** (`@advui/icons`): 56 Lucide icons for web (SVG) and native
  (react-native-svg), with `IconDefaults` for size and color.
- **Utils** (`@advui/utils`): color parsing, OKLCH, contrast and event
  helpers.
- **CLI** (`advui`): `init`, `add` and `list`, backed by a generated
  registry. `list` works before `init` by reading the published registry.
- **Docs site**, published at https://zinmin232.github.io/advui/: component
  pages with live previews, API tables, accessibility and platform notes; a
  playground; a theme customizer; ⌘K search; app examples; and the component
  registry at `/r`. The sidebar has collapsible sections, a guide line with
  category markers, an accent bar on the current page and status badges.
- **Expo playground**: every component, seven app screens and runtime theme
  switching. Runs in Expo Go.
- **Tooling**: `create-component` generator, `rename` script, catalog
  validation, release scripts, Vitest, jest-expo, Playwright e2e with axe, and
  visual regression on Windows and Linux (CI).

### Fixed during pre-release verification

- Toasts were drawn beneath the screen on Android, because the portal zIndex
  overflowed 32 bits.
- Tabs showed no active indicator on native.
- Inputs crashed on Android when given animated border styles.
- On the web, the input icons in the examples and the example badges were
  positioned against the page instead of their own container.
